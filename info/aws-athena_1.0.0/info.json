  "description":"Amazon Web Services offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services. The AWS Assume Role feature, i.e., an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. IAM roles are not associated with a specific user or group. Instead, trusted entities assume roles, such as IAM users, applications, or AWS services such as EC2. Using IAM, you can provide partners, employers, and clients with immediate, secure access to what they need, whenever they need it, by granting IT total control, security, and compliance without friction.",
